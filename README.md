# USGS_3DEP_Python_LIDAR
A project to build an easy-to-use, reliable, and well-designed python `package` that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualize, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. 

###Business objective

AgriTech are very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help us improve our research on new agricultural products being tested on farms. our work at an AgriTech, has a mix of domain experts, data scientists, data engineers. As part of the data engineering team, we are tasked to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. In particular, our code should interface with USGS 3DEP and fetch data using their API. The workflow for this project can be discribed as follows:
### 1. Preparation
- Reading instructions and understand the business needs, the type of data available, the data engineering process(es) that needs to be carried out, the Workflow requirements, and the resources required/available to complete the project
- Planning your work and set up development environment to assist in completing the project
- Exploring a sample of the dataset, understand it structure, the information stored within and develop intuition on how it can be used
- Seting up a github repo, integrate unit testing and CICD for proper code package test and deployment
- Building a codebase that communicates with the provided data source and extract needed information based on the parameters passed.
### 2. Test and Implemetaions
