A project to build an easy-to-use, reliable, and well-designed python `package` that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualize, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. 

### Business objective

AgriTech are very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help us improve our research on new agricultural products being tested on farms. our work at an AgriTech, has a mix of domain experts, data scientists, data engineers. As part of the data engineering team, we are tasked to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. In particular, our code should interface with USGS 3DEP and fetch data using their API. The workflow for this project can be discribed as follows:
### 1. Preparation
- Reading instructions and understand the business needs, the type of data available, the data engineering process(es) that needs to be carried out, the Workflow requirements, and the resources required/available to complete the project
- Planning your work and set up development environment to assist in completing the project
- Exploring a sample of the dataset, understand it structure, the information stored within and develop intuition on how it can be used
- Seting up a github repo, integrate unit testing and CICD for proper code package test and deployment
- Building a codebase that communicates with the provided data source and extract needed information based on the parameters passed.
### 2. Test and Implemetaions
#### Data Fetching and Loading
- Since, our task is to write a modular python code/package to connect to the API, query the data model to select with a specified input and get a desired output. For example, submit a boundary (GPS coordinates polygon) and receive back a raster of the height of the terrain within the boundary. 
The expected inputs and outputs are Inputs are:

    - Field boundary polygon in geopandas dataframe
        - All CRSâ€™s (`coordinate reference systems`) should be accepted 
    - Desired output CRS
- The sourse of the Point Cloud Data can be found here aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://usgs-lidar-public/

#### Terrain Visualization
- In this part we will Include an option to graphically display the returned elevation files as either a 3D render plot or as a heatmap.
### Data Transformation
Topographic wetness index (TWI) - as an additional column returned with geopandas dataframe

- it is a useful model to estimate where water will accumulate in an area with elevation differences. It is a function of slope and the upstream contributing area

### 3. Dependancies
This package is dependent on the following python main packages.

- PDAL
- Laspy
- Geopandas
